Detailed Methodology Explanation
ðŸ”´ LEFT: Traditional Random Sampling Method
Step 1: Start with Exception Pool
â€¢	All 10,000 exceptions are treated equally
â€¢	No distinction between high-risk and low-risk
Step 2: Calculate Simple Sample Size
â€¢	Formula: n = zÂ² Ã— p Ã— q / EÂ²
â€¢	Example: n = (1.96)Â² Ã— 0.15 Ã— 0.85 / (0.05)Â² â‰ˆ 196 samples
â€¢	Single calculation for entire population
Step 3: Random Selection
â€¢	Use random number generator
â€¢	Pick 196 items randomly from 10,000
â€¢	Every exception has equal probability (1.96%)
Step 4: Review Selected Items
â€¢	All samples reviewed with equal priority
â€¢	No risk differentiation
Result: Poor High-Risk Coverage
â€¢	Only ~15-20% of high-risk items detected
â€¢	Most effort wasted on low-risk items
â€¢	Random luck determines whatâ€™s found

ðŸŸ¢ RIGHT: Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Risk-Based Sampling
Step 1: Start with Same Exception Pool
â€¢	Same 10,000 exceptions
â€¢	Ready for intelligent processing
Step 2: Multi-Dimensional Stratification
â€¢	Split by Entity (HBAP, HBEU, HBUS)
â€¢	Further split by Region (LN, NY, HK, etc.)
â€¢	Further split by Product (Equities, IRD, FX, etc.)
â€¢	Optional: Add Desk, Book, Trader dimensions
â€¢	Creates 100+ unique strata
Step 3: Statistical Risk Scoring
â€¢	Calculate exception frequency for each stratum
â€¢	Normalize to risk scores (0.1 to 1.0)
â€¢	Formula: Risk Weight = 1.0 + avg(entity_risk, region_risk, product_risk, desk_risk)
â€¢	Range: 1.1 (lowest risk) to 2.0 (highest risk)
Step 4: Proportional Risk-Weighted Allocation
â€¢	Calculate base sample for each stratum: n_base = (zÂ² Ã— p Ã— q) / EÂ²
â€¢	Apply risk weight: n_adjusted = n_base Ã— Risk_Weight
â€¢	High-risk strata get 2x samples
â€¢	Low-risk strata get 1.1x samples
â€¢	Total samples optimized across all strata
Step 5: Stratified Selection
â€¢	Sample from each stratum proportionally
â€¢	Ensure minimum samples per stratum (e.g., 5)
â€¢	Within high-risk strata, prioritize highest risk scores first
â€¢	Combine all stratum samples into final selection
Result: Excellent High-Risk Coverage
â€¢	70-90% of high-risk items detected
â€¢	Efficient resource allocation
â€¢	Audit-defensible methodology
