Following our recent demo session for the OMRC Enhanced Risk-Based Sampling Proof of Concept, I’d like to thank you all for your time and constructive feedback.
As per our discussion, since the leads are aligned with the approach and its scalability, I’d like to request a Jira ticket creation to formally capture the business and technical requirements for this initiative.  
This Jira will serve as the single reference point for documenting requirements, approach details, validation metrics, and deployment considerations.

Please let me know once the Jira is raised (preferably under the OMRC/Compliance stream), and I will attach all the required documentation for review.
Thank you for your support throughout this review cycle and for confirming alignment on the proposed scalable approach.
